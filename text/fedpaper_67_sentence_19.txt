the second clause of the second section of the second article
 empowers the president of the united states ``to nominate, and by
 and with the advice and consent of the senate, to appoint
 ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the
 supreme court, and all other officers of united states whose
 appointments are not in the constitution otherwise provided for, and
 which shall be established by law.'' immediately after this clause
 follows another in these words: ``the president shall have power to
 fill up ?? vacancies that may happen during the recess of the
 senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of
 their next session.'' it is from this last provision that the
 pretended power of the president to fill vacancies in the senate has
 been deduced. a slight attention to the connection of the clauses,
 and to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us that the
 deduction is not even colorable.
