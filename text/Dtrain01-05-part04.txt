Your humour must be law. [HE TAKES THE FOUR ANGELS.] FACE. Why now, sir, talk. Now I dare hear you with mine honour. Speak. So may this gentleman too. SUB. Why, sir -- [OFFERING TO WHISPER FACE.] FACE. No whispering. SUB. Fore heaven, you do not apprehend the loss You do yourself in this. FACE. Wherein? for what? SUB. Marry, to be so importunate for one, That, when he has it, will undo you all: He'll win up all the money in the town. FACE. How! SUB. Yes, and blow up gamester after gamester, As they do crackers in a puppet-play. If I do give him a familiar, Give you him all you play for; never set him: For he will have it. FACE. You are mistaken, doctor. Why he does ask one but for cups and horses, A rifling fly; none of your great familiars. DAP. Yes, captain, I would have it for all games. SUB. I told you so. FACE [TAKING DAP. ASIDE]. 'Slight, that is a new business! I understood you, a tame bird, to fly Twice in a term, or so, on Friday nights, When you had left the office, for a nag Of forty or fifty shillings. DAP. Ay, 'tis true, sir; But I do think now I shall leave the law, And therefore -- FACE. Why, this changes quite the case. Do you think that I dare move him? DAP. If you please, sir; All's one to him, I see. FACE. What! for that money? I cannot with my conscience; nor should you Make the request, methinks. DAP. No, sir, I mean To add consideration. FACE. Why then, sir, I'll try. -- [GOES TO SUBTLE.] Say that it were for all games, doctor. SUB. I say then, not a mouth shall eat for him At any ordinary, but on the score, That is a gaming mouth, conceive me. FACE. Indeed! SUB. He'll draw you all the treasure of the realm, If it be set him. FACE. Speak you this from art? SUB. Ay, sir, and reason too, the ground of art. He is of the only best complexion, The queen of Fairy loves. FACE. What! is he? SUB. Peace. He'll overhear you. Sir, should she but see him -- FACE. What? SUB. Do not you tell him. FACE. Will he win at cards too? SUB. The spirits of dead Holland, living Isaac, You'd swear, were in him; such a vigorous luck As cannot be resisted. 'Slight, he'll put Six of your gallants to a cloke, indeed. FACE. A strange success, that some man shall be born to. SUB. He hears you, man -- DAP. Sir, I'll not be ingrateful. FACE. Faith, I have confidence in his good nature: You hear, he says he will not be ingrateful. SUB. Why, as you please; my venture follows yours. FACE. Troth, do it, doctor; think him trusty, and make him. He may make us both happy in an hour; Win some five thousand pound, and send us two on't. DAP. Believe it, and I will, sir. FACE. And you shall, sir. [TAKES HIM ASIDE.] You have heard all? DAP. No, what was't? Nothing, I, sir. FACE. Nothing! DAP. A little, sir. FACE. Well, a rare star Reign'd at your birth. DAP. At mine, sir! No. FACE. The doctor Swears that you are -- SUB. Nay, captain, you'll tell all now. FACE. Allied to the queen of Fairy. DAP. Who! that I am? Believe it, no such matter -- FACE. Yes, and that You were born with a cawl on your head. DAP. Who says so? FACE. Come, You know it well enough, though you dissemble it. DAP. I'fac, I do not; you are mistaken. FACE. How! Swear by your fac, and in a thing so known Unto the doctor? How shall we, sir, trust you In the other matter? can we ever think, When you have won five or six thousand pound, You'll send us shares in't, by this rate? DAP. By Jove, sir, I'll win ten thousand pound, and send you half. I'fac's no oath. SUB. No, no, he did but jest. FACE. Go to. Go thank the doctor: he's your friend, To take it so. DAP. I thank his worship. FACE. So! Another angel. DAP. Must I? FACE. Must you! 'slight, What else is thanks? will you be trivial? -- Doctor, [DAPPER GIVES HIM THE MONEY.] When must he come for his familiar? DAP. Shall I not have it with me? SUB. O, good sir! There must a world of ceremonies pass; You must be bath'd and fumigated first: Besides the queen of Fairy does not rise Till it be noon. FACE. Not, if she danced, to-night. SUB. And she must bless it. FACE. Did you never see Her royal grace yet? DAP. Whom? FACE. Your aunt of Fairy? SUB. Not since she kist him in the cradle, captain; I can resolve you that. FACE. Well, see her grace, Whate'er it cost you, for a thing that I know. It will be somewhat hard to compass; but However, see her. You are made, believe it, If you can see her. Her grace is a lone woman, And very rich; and if she take a fancy, She will do strange things. See her, at any hand. 'Slid, she may hap to leave you all she has: It is the doctor's fear. DAP. How will't be done, then? FACE. Let me alone, take you no thought. Do you But say to me, captain, I'll see her grace. DAP. "Captain, I'll see her grace." FACE. Enough. [KNOCKING WITHIN.] SUB. Who's there? Anon. [ASIDE TO FACE.] -- Conduct him forth by the back way.
