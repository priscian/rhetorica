Sensitive to my insensitivity.

Unfriendly to his friend.

Singing songs not sung.

With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder.

There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,
No end to the withering of withered flowers,
To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,
To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,
The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable
Prayer of the one Annunciation....

The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength, fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant....

My own heart's heart, and ownest own, farewell;...

The signora at every grimace and at every bow smiled a little smile and bowed a little bow.

Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.

Judge not, that ye be not judged.

I am a man
More sinned against than sinning.

Let the people think they govern, and they will be governed.

Mrs. Montagu has dropped me. Now, sir, there are people whom one should like very well to drop, but would not wish to be dropped by.

It clearly would not be well for the world that we should always beat other nations and never be beaten.

Our knights are thinking only of the money they will make in ransoms: it is not kill or be killed with them, but payor be paid.

If a League of peace-seeking peoples is set at nought, we must convert it into a League of armed peoples, too faithful to molest others, too strong to be molested themselves.

I followed him; if I was seduced into error, or into unjustifiable opposition, there sits my seducer.

I cannot understand why all solicitors did not leave off soliciting, all doctors leave off doctoring, all judges leave off judging, all benevolent bankers leave off lending money at high interest, and all rising politicians leave off having nothing to add to what their right honourable friend told the House about eight years ago.

In church, in the House of Commons, at public meetings, we sit solemnly listening to bores and twaddlers because from the time we could walk or speak we have been snubbed, scolded, bullied, beaten and imprisoned whenever we dared to resent being bored or twaddled at, or to express our natural impatience and derision of bores and twaddlers.

The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and -- Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.

But here I only remark the interesting fact that the conquered almost always conquer. Sparta killed Athens with a final blow, and she was born again. Sparta went away victorious, and died slowly of her own wounds.

No man forgets his original trade: the rights of nations, and of kings, sink into questions of grammar, if grammarians discuss them.

Such is the crime, and such is the criminal, which it is my duty in this debate to expose, and, by the blessing of God, this duty shall be done completely to the end.

On any other occasion I should think myself justifiable in treating with silent contempt anything which might fall from that honorable member; but there are times when the insignificance of the accuser is lost in the magnitude of the accusation.

We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery. We have men sold to build churches, women sold to support the Gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the poor heathen!

The tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?

Hence perhaps is explained, and not out of any self-oblivion from higher enthusiasm, a fact that often has occurred, of deer, or hares, or foxes, and the pack of hounds in pursuit, chaser and chased, all going headlong over a precipice together.

When Byron divided humanity into the bores and bored, he omitted to notice that the higher qualities exist entirely in the bores, the lower qualities in the bored, among whom he counted himself.

The human mind can not be enshrined in a person who shall set a barrier on anyone side to this unbounded, unboundable empire.

As I got down near the beach a poor woman, oldish, and seemingly, lately at least, respectable, followed me and made signs. She was drenched to the skin, and looked wretched below wretchedness.

Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken;...

The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

If we are only a commercial and manufacturing people, all must admit that commerce was thriving and that manufactures flourished.

All one can say is, roughly, that the homelier the home, and the more familiar the family, the worse for everybody concerned.

All form is formless, order orderless.

They think me mad -- Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!
