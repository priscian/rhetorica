I like jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce.

It went over like a feather of lead.

It is an original copy.

Open secret, tragic comedy, seriously funny, awfully pretty, foolish wisdom, liquid gas.

The vehicle is almost exactly entirely red.

And onto the the room fell a deafening silence.

O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

The shackles of love straiten'd him
His honour rooted in dishonour stood
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true

I find no peace, and all my war is done
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice,
I flee above the wind, yet can I not arise

The bookful blockhead ignorantly read,
With loads of learned lumber in his head,
With his own tongue still edifies his ears,
And always list’ning to himself appears.

I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.

At once as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild,
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all ...

It was a choice between comfortable misery and terrifying uncertainty.

O miserable abundance, O beggarly riches!

O absent presence, Stella is not here;
False flattering hope, that with so fair a face
Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place
Stella, I say my Stella, should appear.

And peradventure had he seen her first
She might have made this and that other world
Another world for the sick man; but now
The shackles of an old love straitened him,
His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.

Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

She can so mould Rome, and her monuments,
Within the liquid marble of her lines,
That they shall stand fresh and miraculous,
Even when they mix with innovating dust;...

That something is nothing.

A wanton modesty. Proud humility.

We may find instances of this kind in the common language of mankind, or that may appear very easy and natural in familiar conversation. A coward dies often, a brave man but once. He is a living death, said of a man in a consumption, or of a malefactor under condemnation. An idiot or a madman is his own grave. No one poorer than that rich man, or he is only a rich beggar, spoken of a wealthy miser.

How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,
How complicate, how wonderful is man!
A beam ethereal, sullied and absorbed!
Though sullied and dishonored, still divine!
Dim miniature of greatness absolute!
An heir of glory! A frail child of dust!
Helpless immortal! Insect infinite!
A worm! A god!

It is an awful topic—but 't is not
My cue for any time to be terrific:
For checkered as is seen our human lot
With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
Of melancholy merriment, to quote
Too much of one sort would be soporific; --
Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
I sketch your world exactly as it goes.

She held herself tight to him and her lips looked for his and then found them and were against them and he felt her, fresh, new and smooth and young and lovely with the warm, scalding coolness and unbelievable to be there in the robe that was as familiar as his clothes, or his shoes, or his duty and then she said, frightenedly, "And now let us do quickly what it is we do so that the other is all gone."

As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold transparent night,
As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of the night,
As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.
