We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.

Mad world! Mad kings! Mad composition!

This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands;
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out--I die pronouncing it--
Like to a tenement or pelting farm.

Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.

Five years have passed; Five summers, with the length of Five long winters! and again I hear these waters.

Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.

Strike as I struck the foe! Strike as I would Have struck those tyrants! Strike deep as my curse! Strike! -- and but once!
